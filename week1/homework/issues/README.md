# Fixing Bugs in JSX
When writing code with React, developers will have to write a lot of JSX. Unfortunately, developers are only human and humans make a lot of mistakes. It is important to catch those mistakes and understand why they are wrong.

Each file contains compiler and runtime errors. You will need to go into the issues of this repo and examine the broken code. When you believe you found the problem make the fix and create a pull request with a description of the changes you made. Feel free to use Code Sandbox or VS Code to help you out!
