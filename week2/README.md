# Week 2: Props and State

This week we'll be going over how to pass information between components. We will learn how props work and introduce ourselves to our first React Hook, `useState`! 

We will also cover some JSX knowledge left out of last week: event handling and how to use the JavaScript`.map()` array method with JSX. By learning these items now, we can apply our new knowledge immediately!

Through these new concepts a component will be able to update information within its parent. Specifically, it can update the parent's state. We'll also go over how a component can update its siblings' information through the siblings' props.

**Objective:**
- Introduce props and state
- Show how we can update a parent's state through its child
- Show how a child can update its siblings props
- Go over event handling and using `.map()'

**Homework:**

Create a video player to  server as practice for updating sibling props
