# Week 2: Props and State

This week we'll be going over how to pass information between components. We will learn how props work and introduce ourselves to our first React Hook, `useState`! There were also a couple parts of JSX left out from last week that we'll cover here, these are event handling and how to use the JavaScript`.map()` array method with JSX. It made more sense to cover those here because we'll be able to apply what we learn immediately.

Through these new concepts a component will be able to update information within its parent. Specifically, it can update the parent's state. We'll also go over how a component can update its siblings information through the siblings props.

**Objective:**
- Introduce props and state
- Show how we can update a parent's state through its child
- Show how a child can update its siblings props
- Go over event handling and using `.map()'

**Homework:**
Create a video player to server as practice for updating sibling props
