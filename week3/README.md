# Week 3: Hooked on Hooks

This week we will be introducing three new React hooks, `useEffect`, `useRef` and `useContext`. We will learn how these hooks work and implement them ourselves in a TodoList project.

We will cover some basic cases implementing these hooks showing them in action as well as how they may be misused. With these new hooks we will be able to add effects to our state and have new ways to pass values to our components. 

**Objective:**
- Introduce Effect, Refs and Context
- Show how we can add effects after renders
- Go over accessing DOM elements with Refs
- Show how to avoid passing props through multiple components
- Build Todo List using Effect, Refs and State

**Homework:**

Create an expense report to serve as practice implementing hooks
