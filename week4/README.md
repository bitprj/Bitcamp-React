# Week 4: Snippet Generator

This week we will be working on our capstone project, a code snippet generator!

### Livestream

During the livestream we will be creating the snippet generator app. 

We'll be going over:

- Setting up VS Code for React development
- How a code snippet is defined and what it is
- Structure of our app
- How to code our app

### Homework

Our snippet generator isn't quite complete yet, our users want us to add couple more features. You will be working on these additions. After that, you will clean up the existing code and make it easier to use by further incorporating React's Context API.
