# Sublime Add-on

Our snippet generator app is gaining popularity and we have users asking if we can add another editor to our app! The editor they are requesting the most is Sublime Text.

For this assignment you will be creating the `<Sublime />` component and adding it to our app to allow our uses to create code snippet for Sublime Text. The format your snippet should be in can be found in Sublime's [documentation](https://sublime-text.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extensibility/snippets.html) (Note: You do not need to include `<scope>`!).
